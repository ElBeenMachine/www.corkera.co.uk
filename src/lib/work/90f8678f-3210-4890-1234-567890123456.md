Do you remember me?

I gaze at the flowers on your coffin

‘Daphne’, because we all remember

you differently: Mum, Nanna, Sister.

Are you wearing your favourite cardigan?

I loved that lilac cardigan. You refused

to wear it without a Marie Curie daffodil.

I should get some daffodils.

Do you promise to stay with me?

I remember clutching my short story

into the hospital, sat right next to you

and from the way you breathed,

I knew you were proud.

Are you happy I chose this life?

I write about Cemaes, Nanna,

and when I saw the daffodils outside

the cathedral, I knew I had to write about you.
