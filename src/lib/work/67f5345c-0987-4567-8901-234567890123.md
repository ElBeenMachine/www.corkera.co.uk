<ins>After Margaret Atwood</ins>

You’re sad because you’re sad,

because you have hormones

so when you ask me for help,

I’ll simply tell you you’re a girl

and you’re simply becoming a woman.

Sit down and speak to your sadness.

What are you actually sad about?

Anything? Nothing.

Journal it, love, because I can’t sort it for you.

Deal with it. Don’t come crying to me.

Have you ever actually considered

that everyone gets sad sometimes?

This house, you kids, this bloody life

makes me sad, but I don’t cry to you.

Be thankful you even have a mum.

If my dad has to deal with his sadness

and sertraline soaks up mine

whilst I pick up after you all day,

then you can accept this.
