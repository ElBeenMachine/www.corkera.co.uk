Dear you,

you know who you are, even if you deny it.

You know you wrung my innocence from me

drop by drop, letting it seep into your sheets,

shattering my sanity into a million and one pieces.

You knew what you were doing - you knew

I didn’t want it, you knew I didn’t want you.

I was just your prey.

I trusted you for a while, you need company.

You were struggling, lonely.

No. You needed fulfil your big boy predatory role

and I fell right into your trap

so you drove me to your alleged home

where you tear your prey apart.

You dragged me up the creaking stairs

by a limp hoodie sleeve, whispering foul words

that you treated like sweet nothings

except the whispers still echo like screams,

their alarms ringing through my ears, a relentless tinnitus.

You ‘needed my body’, ‘needed me’.

No. Screw you.

You never needed my body,

you needed jail for entering me

without permission, a trespasser in my body

because my continuous ‘no’s meant nothing to you.

Sorry, I forgot -

you only understood whatever language predators speak.

Dear you,

let me know when you’re reading this in prison,

when I’ve had the courage to trap you in your own

dark cell. Just you wait until they get hold of you in there.
