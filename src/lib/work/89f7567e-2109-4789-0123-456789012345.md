Hello?

Are you there? Nanna Beach?

Just yesterday I tried on my new dress,

twirled in dizzy circles.

You barely lifted your head off the pillow.

Your sinking eyes pounded your papery under eyes

and that was all the approval I needed.

The drive home was the worst.

Hello?

I could still see you all the way home

reflecting in the front window of the car

like your yellow face reflected

in the window of your powdery, sea shell dotted room.

Morning dawned. I already knew.

Mum and dad held my hand like you always did.

Hello?

I drew a picture of the beach for you

so I had a reason to go back to your room once again.

The hearse drags past the house.

Posies (love and joy) spell out your name.

a blurred wave of white and purple: ‘Daphne’

Hello?

You will always be Nanna Beach to me.
