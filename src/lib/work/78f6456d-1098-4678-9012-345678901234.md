Seaweed sits on the sand,

small crabs creep out, observing.

Waves roll onto velvet sand,

handing in treasure with foamy fingers:

sediment from years ago renewed, revived.

Blue flip flops slip on skins of seaweed

at the rockpools, where baby crabs crawl

behind mother and father, over big stones, little stones,

sand, grains, vibrant creatures.

Small sausage fingers reach, grab a stone,

polished and tumbled to be the shape of a heart.

Eyes sparkle, glinting as bright as the future of this beach.

Auburn ringlets bounce each time

flip flops rebound back onto time refined sand.

Grainy, hot hands press the stone

into a proud motherâ€™s hand.

Here, she holds time.
