Your shaking fingers turned blue.

The lights still twinkled on the tree,

mixing with the blue flashing lights outside

blurring, haunting me every time I blinked.

I waved the paramedics in somehow,

my hands struggling to function,

because they were just so scared

to wave their final goodbye

to you.

All I could do was rub your back,

fill you with false hope:

‘everything will be okay’

and tuck your stained teddy bear under your arm.

The wheelchair squeaked across the wooden floor

while a paramedic attempted to help you breathe,

forcing plastic apparatus over your mouth and nose.

‘We’re taking you to hospital now – everything will be okay’.

Your limp body flopped into the wheelchair,

making it screech a little

and I clutched your hand for dear life,

probably making it more blue.

I will never forget the way you told me

through wheezes in bits of breath

‘I’ll be okay’,

before you were whisked away

to the bright lights of the hospital

and I was left longing for you, my guardian angel,

to tell me ‘Everything will be okay.’

And so I forced myself away from the front door,

advanced towards the Christmas tree,

starved the lights of power,

so that their annoyingly bright colour would stop taunting me.

Christmas will not be okay if you are not here,

your cracker will remain in your place on the table forever,

a glass of shloer untouched. Mum will have to tell us

on Christmas Eve: ‘Everything will be okay.’
