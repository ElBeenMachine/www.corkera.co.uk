Everything happens for a reason –

of course there was a reason

for you to sweep up our two years

and toss them in the bin,

summing them up in a text as

‘a nice time’,

because clearly ‘nice’ was the best I was to you.

Thank you ever so much.

There must have been a thrill to you

reversing everything you once said,

screwing up the words into balls

and burning them in the fire pit.

Our conversation about how you’d never

hurt me died right in front of my face,

so I clutched my duvet, searched

for those words in my bed.

My mother held me whilst tears choked me,

my body withering in an old jumper you left,

yet the only thing choking you was your need

to magic us off into thin air.

She told me whilst I wept:

‘It wasn’t meant to be. Everything happens for a reason’.

Our photos glared from my wall and window sill,

taunting me with such secure smiles

which somehow still showed through dust,

all so I could stare up at the ceiling in bed

breathing in the now stale scent of you still on my pillow.

If I was failing, you felt our relationship rot,

maybe you could have brought that up

in a cowardly message – or a conversation

I did always tell you ‘Communication is key’.

but no, you had to kill us, me, off completely.

Maybe one day I’ll find comfort in somebody telling me

‘It’s okay, everything happens for a reason’,

then I’ll be able to bloom.
