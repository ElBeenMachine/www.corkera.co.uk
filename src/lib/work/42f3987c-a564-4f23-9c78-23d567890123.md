<ins>After Carol Ann Duffy</ins>

Come away into this dark cell and tell

them how you asked for it; you clearly

said he could in your sleep. How dare

you even accuse him of such a thing!

Come away into this dark cell and tell

him that it should be you here instead:

you must be some kind of evil to deserve

that treatment, that invasion.

Come away into this dark cell and tell

yourself that it’s over: there’s no way

you’ll let the scenes from that night

flash in front of you every day of your life.

Come away into this dark cell and tell

them how you asked for it. He’s already

told everybody anyway. Everybody knows.

Shout it from the rooftops that you must

have fucking asked for it.
